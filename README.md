# MDV visualisation of Stratum Corneum membrane and the AlaTrp peptide for the HIVE cylinder
A repo for anyone who attempts to visualise umbrella sampled, replica exchanged, molecular dynamics.


Alternatively these files can be sourced from the HIVE’s databases upon request. a) The optimized parameters for the pull simulation can be found on the Github repository as pull.mdp. b) The Python class made for editing structure files can be found as StructureFile.py, with a test file testfilein.gro. c) The final visualisation files for MDV can be found under the file ‘Files’. d) The bash scripts that automate testing and creation of the final files can be found as pullautomation.sh and replexautomation.sh. e) Finally, videos made for the presentation can be found under ‘videos’.
